    <p style="width:600xp; font-family: Impact, Haettenschweiler, 'Arial Narrow Bold', sans-serif;"> Hi, my name is Edgar Mendoza and since i was 2 i alwaysed love video games. Growing up ive played lots of old games such as doom 2 and contra, along side pokemon and sonic and it always fascinated me on how people could make games that are fun to play. Usually i play online games with my small group of friends like destiny 2 and Rainbow 6 seige and we even play DnD on the weekends. Growing up with a lot of relatives that have different tasts of games made me apretiate all the different genres of games and created some of my most fondest memories with them and the games played. yugioh was also a big part of my upbringin and it made me like other card games and tabletop games like Warhammer 40k. I want to make video games inspired by the games i grew up with and some that deserve more exposure for how obscure they are. </p>
